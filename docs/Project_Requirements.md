| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior / Outcome | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR-001 | Global Hotkey Listener | As a user, I want the application to listen for a specific hotkey combination (`Ctrl + Shift + .`) system-wide so I can trigger it from any application. | The application runs in the background. Pressing `Ctrl + Shift + .` anywhere in Windows triggers the text capture and AI interaction flow. | MUS |
| FR-002 | Selected Text Capture (Clipboard Method) | As a user, I want the application to capture the text I have highlighted when I press the hotkey. | When the hotkey is pressed, the application programmatically copies the selected text to the clipboard and stores it internally for processing. The user's original clipboard content is overwritten. | MUS |
| FR-003 | Local Ollama Integration | As a user, I want the captured text to be sent to my local Ollama instance for processing. | The application sends the captured text to a hardcoded Ollama API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`) and can handle a streaming response. | MUS |
| FR-004 | Basic GUI Overlay | As a user, I want a small window to appear on my screen where I can see the AI's response being generated. | A simple, frameless GUI window appears at the current mouse cursor's position when the hotkey is triggered. | MUS |
| FR-005 | Real-time Response Streaming | As a user, I want to see the AI's response appear word-by-word in the overlay, not all at once at the end. | Text chunks received from the Ollama streaming API are immediately rendered inside the GUI overlay, giving a real-time "typing" effect. | MUS |
| FR-006 | Copy Response Functionality | As a user, I want to easily copy the full response from the overlay to my clipboard. | The overlay window contains a "Copy" button. Clicking it copies the entire generated text to the system clipboard and closes the overlay. | MUS |
| FR-007 | Overlay Dismissal | As a user, I want to be able to close the overlay window easily. | The overlay can be closed by pressing the `Esc` key or by clicking a dedicated "Close" or "X" button on the overlay itself. | MUS |
| FR-008 | Robust Text Capture (UI Automation) | As a user, I want the app to capture selected text without overwriting my clipboard. | The "Clipboard Hack" method (FR-002) is replaced with the Windows UI Automation API for non-destructive and more reliable text capture. | Future |
| FR-009 | Cloud Model Configuration | As a user, I want to connect the app to cloud-based LLMs like OpenAI by providing my API key. | A settings interface is created where a user can enter and save API keys for supported cloud providers (e.g., OpenAI). Keys must be stored securely. | Future |
| FR-010 | Multi-Model Selection | As a user, I want to choose which AI model (local Ollama or a configured cloud model) to use for my query. | The settings interface (or a right-click menu on a tray icon) allows the user to select from a list of available local Ollama models and configured cloud models. | Future |
| FR-011 | "Insert" Text Functionality | As a user, I want the option to insert the AI's response directly into the application I'm working in. | The overlay window has an "Insert" (or "Replace") button. Clicking it pastes the generated text at the user's current cursor location, replacing the originally selected text. | Future |
| FR-012 | Context-Aware Overlay Positioning | As a user, I want the overlay to appear intelligently next to the text I selected, not just where my mouse is. | The application determines the screen coordinates of the highlighted text and positions the GUI overlay adjacent to it. | Future |
| FR-013 | System Tray Icon and Management | As a user, I want a persistent way to manage the app (e.g., open settings, quit) without a main window. | The application has an icon in the Windows system tray. Right-clicking this icon provides a menu with options like "Settings" and "Quit." | Future |
| FR-014 | Configuration Persistence | As a user, I want my settings (API keys, selected model) to be saved between application restarts. | The application saves user configurations to a local file (e.g., JSON or INI) and loads them on startup. | Future |
